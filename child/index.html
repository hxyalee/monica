                We have 9 years left to achieve the Sustainable Development
                Goals (SDG), a 2030 agenda created by the United Nations to
                achieve a sustainable future by combatting challenges including
                poverty, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and
                justice. Currently, child mortality is a major public health
                problem in developing countries. As part of the SDG number 3,
                Good Health and Wellbeing, the target is to reduce under-five
                mortality rate (U5MR) to at least 25 per 1,000 live births in
                every country ("Sustainable Development Goal 3: Health", 2021).
                How can we ensure that we are taking the right plan of action to
                reach this goal?

                Though there has been accelerating progress, the U5MR across

                least 25 per 1,000 live births in every country, however the
                average U5MR in Sub-Saharan Africa is 76 deaths. Children under
                the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa are also 16 times more
                likely to die than in high-income countries due to poor access

                In Sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in 13 children died before their fifth
                birthday in 2019, a rate that is 20 times higher than the rate
                of 1 in 264 in Australia ("Under 5 Mortality, 2020").
                Sub-Saharan Africa’s child mortality rate is far behind the
                current global average, indicating the urgency to take action in
                accelerating progress towards improving their healthcare.

                There is a vast difference in child mortality rates among
                African countries as displayed in the bar graph above. Countries
                in the northern region such as Tunisia and Morocco have already
                reached the target mortality rate set in the SDGs, whereas sub
                Saharan countries such as Chad and Central African Republic are
                far from the target. Let’s take a closer look into select

                  Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal mortality rate
                  (MMR) among the world, Chad being the most dangerous country
                  to give birth in (Suzuki & Kashiwase, 2019). These deaths are
                  caused by complications such as severe bleeding, infections,
                  complications during delivery and unsafe abortion. “Fewer than
                  half of all births (in this region) are assisted by such
                  skilled health personnel” due to the lack of access to quality
                  health services and emergency care ("Maternal mortality",
                  2019).

                <p>
                  As part of the SDG 3, they aim to “reduce the global MMR to
                  less than 70 per 100 000 births”, which is far from where Sub
                  Saharan Africa is currently at. The result of maternal death
                  arise from complications that develop during pregnancy are
                  mostly preventable or treatable by simply providing accessible
                  health care solutions. ("Maternal mortality", 2019).
                  Therefore, it is crucial to prioritise eliminating barriers in
                  the healthcare system such as lack of information, poor
                  quality services and distance to facilities to improve
                  maternal health.
